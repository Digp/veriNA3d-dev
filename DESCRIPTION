Description: Structural bioinformatics is a hard field we work to make easier.
    We provide tools to extract information from PDB structures, manage these 
    data and save the results in different kinds of plots. The package was 
    developed (and so the examples and vignettes) to do data mining with PDB 
    data focused on RNA, but most of its functionalities are extensible to the 
    analysis of any PDB structure.
