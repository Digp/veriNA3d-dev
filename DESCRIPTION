Description: Structural bioinformatics is a hard field we work to make easier.
    We provide tools to extract information from PDB structures, manage these 
    data and save the results in different kinds of plots. The package was 
    developed (and so the examples and vignettes) to do data mining  with RNA 
    data, but most of its functionalities are extensible to the analysis of
    any PDB structure.
