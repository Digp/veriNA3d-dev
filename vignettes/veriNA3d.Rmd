# Introduction

AAA

# Main use case: Manage Nucleic Acid datasets

Get Leontis list, change representative structures and analyse them with one 
of the pipelines

# Use case: Querying the EMBL-EBI REST API

Query EBI API and how to construct new queries!

# Use case: eRMSD

For two NMR models of RNA/DNA, compute the eRMSD

# Use case: Generate substructures

For a given structure (CIF or PDB), generate a smaller PDB with the region of 
interest and surroundings
